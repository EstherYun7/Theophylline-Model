# 1 Introduction
Theophylline is used for therapy for respiratory diseases. It is metabolized by both CYP1A2 and CYP2E1. The fraction excreted unchanged in urine is 25%. 


# 2 Methods


## 2.1 Modeling Strategy
The general concept of building a PBPK model has previously been described by Kuepfer et al. ([Kuepfer 2016](# 5 References)) Regarding the relevant anthropometric (height, weight) and physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, binding protein concentrations, hematocrit, cardiac output) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been previously published ([PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3](# References)). The information was incorporated into PK-Sim速 and was used as default values for the simulations in adults.

The  applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim速 are described in the publicly available PK-Sim速 Ontogeny Database Version 7.3 ([Schlender 2016](# 5 References)) or otherwise referenced for the specific process.

First, a base mean model was built using literature data including selected intravenous single dose studies with Ondansetron to find an appropriate structure to describe the pharmacokinetics in plasma. The mean PBPK model was developed using a typical European individual.



For clearance, first order process was assumed. Specific clearance and lipophilicity were optimized based on the observed plasma concentration vs. time coefficients using the Parameter Identification module provided in PK-Sim速. 

The model was then verified by simulating:

- plasma concentration vs. time profile 

Details about input data (physicochemical, *in vitro* and clinical) can be found in  [Section 2.2](#2.2	Data).

Details about the structural model and its parameters can be found in  [Section 2.3](#2.3 Model Parameters and Assumptions).

Details about model development was described in Yun and Edginton (2019).

A literature search was performed to collect available clinical data on dapagliflozin in healthy adults.

#### 2.2.2.1	Model Building

The following studies were used for model building (training data):

| Publication     | Arm / Treatment / Information used for model building        |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Steinijans 1987 | Healthy Subjects with a single intravenous dose of 506 mg infused for 8 hours |
| Gisclon 1997    | Healthy Subjects with a single intravenous dose of 4.5 mg/kg infused for 30 minutes |

#### 2.2.2.2	Model Verification

The following studies were used for model verification:

| Publication | Arm / Treatment / Information used for model building |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| ...         | ...                                                   |
| ...         | ...                                                   |


## 2.3 Model Parameters and Assumptions
### 2.3.1	Absorption

Not applicable as an intravenous route was used.

### 2.3.2	Distribution

...

After testing the available organ-plasma partition coefficient and cell permeability calculation methods built in PK-Sim, observed clinical data was best described by choosing the partition coefficient calculation by `Rodgers and Rowland` and cellular permeability calculation by `PK-Sim Standard`. 

...

### 2.3.3	Metabolism and Elimination

Ondansetron undergoes primarily hepatic metabolism specifically CYP 3A4 and CYP 1A2. The fraction excreted unchanged in urine is 5%. 

### 2.3.4	Automated Parameter Identification
