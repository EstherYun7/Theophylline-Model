# Theophylline-Model
Whole body PBPK model of Theophylline

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of Theophylline. The PK-Sim project file contains simulations of published clinical studies employed during model establishment, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [1]. The model is also suitable for pediatric translations with regard to CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 ontogeny.
